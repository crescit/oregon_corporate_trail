# Corporate Life Sim v2

![Corporate Life Sim banner](corporate-life-sim-banner.png)

A snarky NES.css-powered web game where you try to survive a modern corporate routine.
“It’s like Oregon Trail, but instead of dysentery, you get Slack fatigue.”

- Commute to work, badly
- Choose your after-work fate (Work Late, Impress Boss, Commute Home, or Happy Hour)
- Endure weekends of freelancing, unexpected guests, or mild joy
- Manage your money 💵 and sanity 🧠 until burnout or bankruptcy

Built with:
- Vanilla JS + NES.css
- `localStorage` state (persists until your real-life resignation)
- Mobile-friendly and dark-mode by default
